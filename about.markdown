I'm Steven Impson. A software developer, writer and podcaster in Adelaide, South Australia.

I currently work in debt management system maintenance and improvement during the day, and write and podcast about video games in the rest of the time.

# Current Projects

I make a podcast with my good friend Chris Button, exploring the wealth of games on offer on the Apple Arcade service.
