I'm Steven Impson. A software developer, writer and podcaster in Adelaide, South Australia.

I develop back-end software during the day, and muse about video games in the rest of the time.

I make a [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/mobile-arcade-club-an-apple-arcade-show/id1481744430) with my good friend [Chris Button](https://twitter.com/Bibbybhoy), exploring the wealth of games on offer on the Apple Arcade service and you can find my writing at [Press Start Australia](https://press-start.com.au/author/stevenimpson/), [Reckoner](https://reckoner.com.au/author/stevenimpson/) and [Vooks](https://www.vooks.net/author/steven-impson/).
