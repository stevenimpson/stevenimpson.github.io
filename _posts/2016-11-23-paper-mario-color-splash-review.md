*Paper Mario: Color Splash* is not another Thousand Year Door. I feel this needs to be said straight up, as if you go in hoping for another Paper Mario with a turn-based strategic party battle system, you won’t find it. Color Splash is only an RPG in the loosest definition and expecting that does the game a disservice. Color Splash is another thing though; a ridiculously well written, incredible looking, joyous sounding romp with a tedious but dynamic battle system.

Color Splash’s writing is absolutely its greatest asset. The Paper Mario series has always been laden with comedy and the latest instalment continues the tradition. I was taken aback by just how much I enjoyed so much of the character interaction in the game. It felt like nary a line of dialogue went by that didn’t make me grin from ear to ear or even laugh to myself out loud. There have been complaints about Nintendo’s localisation teams leaning too heavily on meme culture at the expense of writing being timeless and humour is of course objective, but to me they never crossed the line into trashiness. More than anything else, I kept playing in anticipation of the next giggle.
