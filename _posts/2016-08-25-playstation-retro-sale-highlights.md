The PlayStation Store is currently having a sale on a bunch of retro PlayStation games. I’ve rounded up some of the great games that you may have missed over the years. You can see the full range HERE. The sale will end on September 8th.

Max Payne (PS4/PS3) – $14.95
A revolutionary hit for the PC, Max Payne was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and that is the version we have here. Max Payne has you “shootdodging” in slow motion, Matrix-style, mowing down endless streams of gangsters. The action rarely lets up, it’s exhilarating. It might turn off players more used to modern sensibilities, but if you can put that aside Max Payne takes you for a ride through an incredible film noir story of drugs, murder, corruption and tragedy.

Mega Man Legacy Collection (PS4) – $11.95
A labour of love from lifelong Mega Man fans, Legacy Collection brings together the first six Mega Man games from the NES to current platforms for experienced players to revisit, and for new players to discover. Hugely challenging, the Mega Man series gained a reputation in it’s day for pixel perfect platforming and shooting action that still endures today. There’s a whole bunch of Mega Man to play in these six games and this is the best way to play these classics today.
