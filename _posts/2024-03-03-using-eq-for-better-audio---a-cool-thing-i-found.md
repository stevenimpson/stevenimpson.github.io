I've been using these little AudioEngine A2 speakers pretty close to daily since I bought them in 2012. Twelve damn years ago! They're so damn nice sounding for little speakers that don't demand huge chunks of my desk space. The other day however, I came across a [tweet from John Linneman](https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1759857299177250910) about using EQ to get better sound from these diminuitive little boxes, so I gave it a try.

It was a bit of a task to work out given the software John uses is Windows specific and a lot of the commonly recommended Mac alternatives were unsupported or just plain creaky. As often happens with audio related things on a Mac it was Rogue Amoeba to the rescue with a slick little app called [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/). Mostly used as a way to granularly direct sound to and fro on a Mac, I saw it had precisely the feature I needed - the ability to apply EQ to specific output devices.

I grabbed the DSP Correction file from [noaudiophile](https://noaudiophile.com/DSP_Corrections/AudioEngine_A2_Plus.php), it imported into SoundSource without fuss and instantly my little speakers sounded better. Doing some on/off experiments revealed less booming in bass, but still a lot of nicely defined bass along with a clearer higher end that made songs pop more than they had in years! 

I'd loved these speakers for twelve years already, and now they're even better.
