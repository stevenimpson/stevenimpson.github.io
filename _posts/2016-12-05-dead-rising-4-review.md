Dead Rising 4 is a silly Christmas game. It’s like one of those straight to video films you’d see at your local rental store right around this time of year, fun while it lasts but not really something you’ll be thinking about too much, or coming back to later on.

Though there is a short prologue featuring Frank West (now apparently a professor of journalism) and his student uncovering a conspiracy at a military base, the game proper starts back at Willamette Mall. This being the same mall where the Frank gained his fame by uncovering and documenting the first zombie outbreak, which will bring some nostalgic feelings on for long time fans.

After these nostalgic feelings wear off, you’re presented with a game full of characters that aren’t interesting and a hackneyed storyline. The basic premise, according to the developers, was to make players see parallels between the mindless consumerism of Black Friday and the mindless behaviour of zombies in a shopping mall. This would be an interesting concept if it hadn’t been done to death already in what could be called the progenitor of the modern zombie film, Dawn of the Dead. But it’s even worse that the same concept was already explored in the very first Dead Rising game.
