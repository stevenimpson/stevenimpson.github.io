title: "Worms WMD Review - A Whole Bunch of Fun"

Some of my absolute favourite multiplayer sessions have been thanks to Worms 2 and its immediate sequels Armageddon and World Party. After Worms World Party though, it felt like the Worms games had lost their direction. Moving to 3D made things needlessly complex, losing the simplicity that made Worms accessible and deceptively deep. The series returned to 2D after a few unsuccessful 3D titles but I never felt like it quite recaptured the joy of the earlier games. Worms WMD might be the closest the series has come to recapturing the essence of it’s origins.

There’s not much in the way of story in Worms WMD. It’s never been a series about establishing lore, with narrative taking a back seat to strategy and humour. The closest thing to a story you’ll find in single-player will be the Campaign missions. These are set scenarios with specific levels and teams built around a theme, often very loosely around historical conflict. If you play with friends though, there will inevitably be stories forged in the heat of combat. A perfectly aimed and strategically bounced grenade going off at the perfect time or a wonderful accident setting off an unbelievable chain reaction of chaos and destruction, there is the potential for some truly memorable moments.
