Ninja Pizza Girl is a game about bullying and resilience. It’s a game about freely running and jumping across a city’s rooftops. It’s also a game about delivering pizza. Built by a family development team in Australia, Ninja Pizza Girl is a self-described ‘serious game’ dealing with themes not often broached on the medium.

Our story centres around Gemma, the eponymous Ninja Pizza Girl. Working for her father’s local pizza store, she is tasked with delivering pizzas across the rooftops of her city’s slums before they get cold. Throughout the game, the people you deliver pizza to have their own story vignettes that might play out over a few levels. While their stories are only short, these characters come from a diverse range of backgrounds and all are dealing with their own concerns that Gemma is determined to help with. It’s encouraging to see such a diverse range of people represented in the game, as short as their stories may be.
